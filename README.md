- Project Title
This project is a guide to train a yolov8 model with a custom dataset and dockerize the model

- Project Description
The project is a guide to train a yolov8 model with a custom dataset and dockerize the model. The project is divided into two parts. The first part is to train the yolov8 model with a custom dataset and the second part is to dockerize the model. 

- Project Structure
Step 1 : Find a dataset compatible with yolov8 format and download it ✅
Step 2 : Explore the dataset and understand the structure of the dataset ✅
Step 3 : Use a k-validation method to split the dataset into training and testing ✅
Step 4 : Fine-tune the yolov8 model with the cross validation method the dataset
Step 5 : Fine-tune the model with hyperparameter tuning
Step 6 : Test the model with the testing dataset
Step 7 : Evaluate the model with the testing dataset
Step 8 : Save the model and the weights

- Dockerize the model
Step 9 : Create a docker image with the model and the weights
Step 10 : Create a docker container with the docker image
Step 11 : Test the docker container with a new image
Step 12 : Evaluate the docker container with the new image
Step 13 : Save the docker container


This final goal of this project is to be able to play rock paper scissors against the computer by detecting the hand gesture of the player through a webcam.
